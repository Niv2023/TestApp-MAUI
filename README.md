# TestApp-MAUI
Simple app for testing MAUI features
This App is for testing MAUI features (controls/services/plugins/etc.)
Its primarily focus is to test multi-platform features for mobile applications (Android/IOS)
This initial version just has some flyout/pages controls for testing localization features.
Specifically changing the application language on real time.
I have based this app on template provided by Gerad Versluis in “Translate Your .NET MAUI App with LocalizationResourceManager.Maui”.
